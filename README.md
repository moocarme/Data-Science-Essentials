# Essentials of Data Science - Week 1

Extending from the in-class work looking at the American and German opinions of their growing trade agreement, my goal here is to understand if how the opinion of Americans varies with age on the recent trade agreement with Germany. My hypothesis is that older Americans are less favourable to the recent trade agreements.

The data comes from the Pew research center, which can be found at 'http://www.pewglobal.org/category/datasets/?download=31944' and is included here in the github folder as Pew_trade.sav.

The work can be viewed in the HTML file included or online at http://rpubs.com/moocarme/EDS-1
