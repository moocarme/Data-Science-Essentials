My hypothesis is that older Americans are less favourable to the recent trade agreements.\r\n\r\nThe data comes from the Pew research center, which can be found at 'http://www.pewglobal.org/category/datasets/?download=31944' and is included here in the github folder as Pew_trade.sav.\r\n\r\nThe work can be viewed in the HTML file included or online at http://rpubs.com/moocarme/EDS-1\r\n\r\n## Project\r\nMy project looks at how stock market prices flutuate and I hope to determine whether they can be predicted in some way by looking at news sources on the internet.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that many fluctuations in the stock market prices may be predicted by analysing news reports, twitter feeds, etc. For example the stock prices of Apple climb at the release of a new product, around the time of the release there is likely to be many different news reports and articles posted amongst the web, as well as many consumers tweeting their excitement for the upcoming product.\r\n\r\nBy incorporating this information perhaps I can better predict large flutuations in stock market prices and generate higher returns on investments.\r\n\r\nThe work can be viewed in the HTML file included or online at http://rpubs.com/moocarme/EDS-Project-Wk1\r\n",
